# Classic arcade game clone
The "classic arcade game clone" is a website built for educational (practice objective programming in javascript) and fun purposes. The user controls a player and tries to reach the end of the canvas while avoiding the enemies. The game involves a unique football theme.

### How to run

The game should be available on <a href="https://v-for-vaggelis.github.io/Classic-Arcade-Game-Clone/"> this live page</a>

### How to Play
Move the player around with the arrow keys. In order to score try to avoid the "tackling" enemies and reach the goal. Each time you score the scoreboard gets updated. Your enemies will score if you collide with them. There is no ultimate winning condition in this game, just the score count, you can play forever. As an extra motive there are some items to collect. **In order to collect those items you must pick them and score the next goal, if you get tackled you will drop them.**. Finally you can pick another player from the bench for fun.

### Code dependencies
This website was not built from scratch, I used the **code for the art assets and game engine provided by Udacity** through this repository: <a href="https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game">https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game</a>.

### Compatibility and other issues
This game is **built for desktop devices**. Even though the website is expected to load on any device, the game will probably work only for desktop devices (laptops and portable computers). As for browser compatibility, the game was tested on Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox where it works fine. It was also **tested on Internet Explorer where it does not work** for unknown reasons. Please contact if you find out the reason or if you run across any other issues.
