# Classic arcade game clone
The "classic arcade game clone" is a website built for educational and fun porposes. The user controls a player and tries to reach the end of the canvas while avoiding the enemies.

### How to run
The game should start automatically once the webpage is loaded in a browser.

### How to Play
Move the player around with the arrow keys. In order to win, try to reach the sea by avoiding the enemy bugs. If you collide with a bug, or win, the game will restart your player. In case you've been playing for a while and the bugs seem like they're moving in a certain pattern, reload the page to shuffle their movements.

### Code dependencies
This website was not built from scratch, I used the **code for the art assets and game engine provided by Udacity** through this repository: <a href="https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game">https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game</a>.

### Compatibility and other issues
This game is **built for desktop devices**. Even though the website is expected to load on any device, the game will probably work only for desktop devices (laptops and portable computers). As for browser compatibility, the game was tested on Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox where it works fine. It was also **tested on Internet Explorer where it does not work** for unknown reasons. Please contact if you find out the reason or if you run across any other issues.
